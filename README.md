# HandWritten Digit Identification: PyTorch vs. TensorFlow

The purpose of this notebook is to compare deep learning models built by PyTorch and TensorFlow for identifying handwritten digits. 

The  collection used in this notebook is found in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jcprogjava/handwritten-digits-dataset-not-in-mnist) and is not from the MINST dataset. There are 10773 images of each of the ten digits in PNG format. In the following, I will, first, make a DataFrame of the images' pixel data and build neural network models using PyTorch and TensorFlow.
